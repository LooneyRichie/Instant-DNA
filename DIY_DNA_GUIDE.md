# üß¨ DIY DNA EXTRACTION & MANUAL GENOTYPING GUIDE

## The Complete Q-Tip to VCF Workflow

This guide shows you how to extract DNA at home using basic materials and manually enter genotyping results for analysis.

## üß™ DIY DNA EXTRACTION (Home Method)

### Materials Needed:
- **Q-tips** (cotton swabs) - sterile preferred
- **Salt water** - 1 tsp salt + 1/4 cup warm water
- **Clear dish soap** - 1-2 drops (Dawn works well)
- **Rubbing alcohol** - 70% or higher, chilled
- **Small clear containers** - shot glasses work
- **Magnifying glass** (optional)
- **Microscope** (optional, for advanced analysis)

### Extraction Steps:

1. **Sample Collection** (5 minutes)
   ```bash
   - Rinse mouth with water, wait 10 minutes
   - Swab inside of cheek vigorously for 30 seconds
   - Roll Q-tip to collect maximum cells
   - Use multiple Q-tips for better yield
   ```

2. **Cell Lysis** (5 minutes)
   ```bash
   - Swirl Q-tip in salt water for 30 seconds
   - Add 1-2 drops dish soap
   - Mix gently for 1 minute (breaks cell membranes)
   - Let sit for 2 minutes
   ```

3. **DNA Precipitation** (10 minutes)
   ```bash
   - Slowly pour cold rubbing alcohol down side of container
   - Don't mix - let alcohol layer on top
   - DNA will precipitate as white stringy material
   - Wait 5-10 minutes for maximum precipitation
   ```

4. **DNA Collection**
   ```bash
   - Use clean toothpick or pipette
   - Collect white stringy DNA strands
   - Transfer to clean container
   - Can store in alcohol at 4¬∞C for days
   ```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:
- Home extraction yields crude DNA suitable for **educational purposes**
- Professional sequencing requires lab-grade equipment
- Results are estimates based on observable traits
- Consider this a fun learning exercise, not medical diagnosis

## üîç MANUAL GENOTYPING METHODS

### Method 1: Phenotype-Based Estimation

Use your physical traits to estimate genotypes:

#### üëÅÔ∏è Eye Color (rs12913832 - HERC2 gene)
- **Brown/Dark eyes**: Likely `GG` (90% confidence)
- **Blue eyes**: Likely `AA` (85% confidence)
- **Green/Hazel**: Likely `GA` (70% confidence)

#### ü¶∞ Red Hair (rs1805007 - MC1R gene)
- **Red hair**: Likely `TT` (95% confidence)
- **Carrier (parent/child with red hair)**: `CT` (80% confidence)
- **No red hair**: `CC` (70% confidence)

#### ü•õ Lactose Tolerance (rs4988235)
- **Can drink milk without issues**: `GG` (80% confidence)
- **Lactose intolerant**: `AA` (85% confidence)
- **Sometimes issues**: `GA` (60% confidence)

#### üëÇ Earwax Type (rs17822931 - ABCC11)
- **Wet, sticky earwax**: `GG` (95% confidence)
- **Dry, flaky earwax**: `AA` (95% confidence)

### Method 2: Family History

Research your ancestry and family traits:

#### üåç Ancestry Markers
- **European ancestry**: rs3827760 ‚Üí likely `GG`
- **African ancestry**: rs2814778 ‚Üí likely `CC`  
- **East Asian ancestry**: rs671 ‚Üí likely `GG`

### Method 3: Advanced DIY (For Science Enthusiasts)

With additional equipment:

#### üî¨ Restriction Enzyme Analysis
- Use EcoRI, BamHI enzymes (if available)
- PCR amplification of target regions
- Gel electrophoresis to visualize bands
- Compare band patterns to known genotypes

#### üß¨ Microscopic Analysis
- High-power microscope (400x+)
- DNA staining (methylene blue)
- Compare DNA structure patterns
- Estimate base composition

## üìù MANUAL DATA ENTRY

### Quick Start
```bash
# Show DIY markers and start interactive session
./instant-dna diy --sample "YourName" --output my_dna.vcf --interactive --load-markers
```

### Entry Format
```
rsid,chromosome,position,genotype,confidence,method
```

### Examples:
```bash
rs12913832,15,28365618,GG,0.9,visual_trait     # Brown eyes
rs1805007,16,89986091,CC,0.8,visual_trait      # No red hair  
rs4988235,2,136608646,GG,0.7,phenotype         # Lactose tolerant
rs17822931,16,48258198,GG,0.9,phenotype        # Wet earwax
rs3827760,7,2723432,GG,0.6,ancestry            # European ancestry
```

### Confidence Levels:
- **0.9-1.0**: Very confident (obvious physical trait)
- **0.7-0.8**: Moderately confident (family history)
- **0.5-0.6**: Educated guess (ancestry/research)
- **0.1-0.4**: Low confidence speculation

### Methods:
- `visual_trait`: Observable physical characteristic
- `phenotype`: Functional trait (lactose tolerance)
- `family_history`: Based on relatives
- `ancestry`: Population/ethnic background
- `lab_test`: If you have actual test results
